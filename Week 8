**************** 10th - 16th August 2017 *******************
Date: 10th August 32017
Tasks:
  1. make sure all the fs are the same(rely on the robot sampling rate) (5 min)
  2. demodulation function of 4 bits and debug it(1 hour)
  3. check the bandwidth of signal(each symbol assigned 100 milli seconds to handle so that the BW = 20Hz)(15 min)
  4. check carrier spectrum of each function
  5. roughly envelope detection(do not need hilbert function, just need use abs function and low pass filter)
  6. autocriticism is a daily task (three times)
Results:
  1. Done
  2. Failed
  3. Done (And I changed the bandwidth to 400Hz which can plot better spectrum)
  4. Done
  5. Done
  6. 50% Done (Not enough)
Summary:
  Today just like any other day.

Date: 11th August 2017
Summary:
  Tomorrow will be another busy day.
  I really need to think about some problems.
  Really tired now, I wanna date with my bed.

Date: 12th-14th August 2017
Tasks:
  1. Add different noise level into signal and test the bits error (noise range from 0 to 20dB)
  2. calculate average bits error (require lots of tests)
  3. complete task 2 I haven't finish yet (2 hours)
  4. linux command learning (1 hours) * 3
  5. organize resources for dissertation (2 hours)
Results:
  1. Failed (TAT)
  2. Failed (TAT)
  3. 50% Done (something wrong with that)
  4. Done (2 videos in youtube)
Summary:
  Q1: why the demodulated waveforms are so wired?!?! not filter parameters(order, bandwidth)
  A1: I will double check modulation function to make sure the modulated part is correct.
  Q2: how to generate different noise level in matlab?
  A2: awgn function, (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23690766/proper-way-to-add-noise-to-signal)
  Q3: how to calculate bits error?
  A3: Compare the original digital signal with demodulated digital signal, and calculate the different digits number.
      It requires thousands test. so I will make a function to calculate the bits error!!!yeah!!!Lazy forever!!!~~~~
      
  I should start to my final dissertation.
