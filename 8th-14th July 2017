****** WEEK 4 ******
Date: 14th July 2017
Summary:
  This week I done several things and got two days off. I think I was too lazy this week so that I need change in the next week.
  Anyway, keep going. Tomorrow is another day! 
  
  
  
  
I argued with tiny brother. I feel quite frustrate. I do not even know his real feeling.
I do not know what tomorrow looks like. I have loads of things should do.
Life is so hard. I hope I can...



I do miss himï¼ŽFor tiny bro, I might be a falling leaf which is just reflect in his eyes for one second.
Alright. I will back to study tomorrow!!!!! I still own my own. Good night, dear world!
