Summary:
  I wasted time day by day and did nothing.
  How stupid I am. But I would not give up! I will be a brilliant coder!!!
  I misunderstood the interfaces and operations!!!! 
  Above all, flow as following:
  1-> review the input interfaces, simulate input operations and fields
  2-> create dataset, which includes essential fields
  3-> table_info::, only operate DB by using simple sql sentences (flexible with conditions in c++)
  4-> memcache_info::, which can use table_info:: (get - clean)
  5-> function_service, which matching different operations via SWITCH structure, logical judgement, use memcache_info:: and table_info::
  6-> xxx.h file, declare matching cpp files
  7-> compile all, debug all
  8-> scp to test server
  9-> restart service.sh
  10-> testpl
  ATTENTION:
  -> all of change of service.cpp, memcache_info.cpp, table_info.cpp required to change their matching xxx.h files
  -> all the data which obtained by memcache_info::, should be clean after used, in case data in mess
  -> data flow, input parameters and output parameters
  -> classify input parameters and functions
  The requirement for myself: research one thing in deep, got the main point from other similar things!!!(within this 10 days)
  Exhausted....I don't want to be the one who hinder the development of group... so that I must keep moving faster!!! GOOD NIGHT~
