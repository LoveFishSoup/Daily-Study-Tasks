Date: 10th August 32017
Tasks:
  1. make sure all the fs are the same(rely on the robot sampling rate) (5 min)
  2. demodulation function of 4 bits and debug it(1 hour)
  3. check the bandwidth of signal(each symbol assigned 100 milli seconds to handle so that the BW = 20Hz)(15 min)
  4. check carrier spectrum of each function
  5. roughly envelope detection(do not need hilbert function, just need use abs function and low pass filter)
  6. autocriticism is a daily task (three times)
