**************** 27th July - 2nd August 2017 *******************
Date: 27th July 2017
Tasks:
  1. envelop detection
  2. FFT (bloody stupid FFT sampling audio file has god knows filter function!!!!!!!go to hell okay?!!?!? I really get angry!!!)
Results:
  1. 10% Done
  2. 20% Done
  3. learned some new linux commands on Youtube(such as cat, nano, killall, rmdir.......and some basics)
  4. learned a new command can transfer list into matrix with any colum (vec2mat(input, number_of_elements_each_vector))
Summary:
  Q1:I should make 5 pieces of snapchat of each symbol by using FFT, but how to realise the filter function via FFT???
  Q2:I can see the envelope waveform, but how to plot this waveform, should I make a function to represent it???
  Q3:I don't know if I need to set the sampling points by calculating the symbols or just set a large number???
  Q4:I tried to create 4 bits/symbol signal today, but I got confused about use 'switch' function. The aim is to create 8 amplitudes
     for each carriers, and the matrix vector got 16 possibilities. Do I need set a loop?!？！How I can extract the number of vectors
     and compare with 0000-1111?!?! My head will boom boom boom.....TAT (I really do not want to use loads of 'if' to judge the 
     statements so that I have to consider a perfect solution!!!
  Motherfxxker!!! I am a totally trouble-maker!!!!!!!! How stupid I am!!!!!!
  I found loads of questions, I hope I can solve them all after I wake up......Good luck to myself~~~~
  I learn a new piece of English song for ukulele. How talent I am?!!??!?! I am a artist!!!!!hahahhahahahahaha~~~~~lalala
  I sent a lovely song to tiny bro, but he didn't reply me even one word!!! How dare he!!!! I am gonna give him some color c c!

Tasks:
  1. solve the questions that I list
  2. prepare something
  3. learn something new about linux on Youtube
Results:
  1. Only get some considerations
  2. Done
  3. Failed
Summary:
  I went to Dublin for some personal things so that I cannot follow my schedule on time.

Day-off

********************************************************
Date: 30th July 2017
Tasks:
  1. Compelete previous tasks
  2. Start healthy lifestyle
Results:
  1. List the things that I should do, and get some ideas about how to implement it
  2. Long time for running........TAT 
  3. Q3 Done, keep the sampling points as small as possible, e.g. 128, 256 and got roughly pulse shape
  4. Q4 50% Done, some mistakes still exist and I do not know where is wrong??!?!!
Summary:
  I waste too much energy in the morning so that I cannot follow my schedule ideally.
  I have to learn how to manage time efficiency and just focus on the project.
  There are several things that I should do tomorrow:
  I,    check online how to use pulse shaping to narrow the bandwidth of carrier (like 750Hz)
  II,   take 5 pieces of snapshots of input signal via FFT, assume sent 10 symbols per second and each symbol last 100 milli second
  III,  got the spectrum of these pieces and analyse the carrier components in spectrum then demodulate the input audio signal
  Iv,   consider what is the correct symbol rate to use

  Date: 31st July 2017
  Tasks:
    1. spectrums
    2. demodulated signals
    3. envelope detection roughly pulse shaping waveform
    4. make it as a function for 2 bits per symbol first
  Results:
    1. 50% Done
    2. Failed! Too damn hard!
    3. Failed
    4. Done 100%
 Summary:
  I revised the functions and lower the input parameters of function that makes it easier. 
    
********************************************************    
Date: 1st-2nd August 2017
Summary:
I done function for 4 bits per symbol for modulation. I tried to think out a suitable way to demodulate the signals but failed.
Symbol rate is related to the bandwidth of carriers. 
The resolytion refer to sampling points.
The result of FFT is a complex number of N sampling points.
bits rate and baud rate can be calculated via bandwidth of carriers.
