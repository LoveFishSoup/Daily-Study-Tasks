Summary:
  Q1: If I wanna build a image recognition system for automatic driving, how to realize surrounding environment detection
      at night?
  A1: (SLAM. Simultaneous localization and mapping. It makes me remind my roommate----Sam. SLAM can detect the laser 
      that transfer by itself. SLAM could be useful.)
      The above solution is infeasible because SLAM rely on the reflection laser signal. Thus, it used more frequently 
      at indoor environment.
      I guess that the car could use infrared ray to detect the objects in real-time environment. Or, it could use transfer
      electromagnetic wave to detect objects and ppl.
  S2: I found that the program are quite similar in some aspects. Seems like I got something but I cannot speak it out.
  S3: php is a programming language which is more suitable for SQL because of it is a web develop language.
  S4: I bought a cloud server for fun.
  S5: Unicode used in memory space while UTF-8 used to transfer and storage. In general, we use UTF-8 in python.

  1. ICP algorithm theory (iteration closet point)
  2. MySQL tutorial *10
  3. web scrapy with python theory
  4. self-test
  5. a coursewave of ML notes
Results:
  1. 20% Done (the program is too damn long!!!)
  2. Failed but python tutorial *4
  3. Failed
  4. Failed
  5. ElasticSearch (http://blog.csdn.net/sdksdk0/article/details/78469190 just in case)
  6. Use my little bro's grandfather low configuration PC to build a suitable environment for programming
Summary:
  Too much things need to learn. I should be more efficient!!! I want to focus on Algorithm!!!
  The learning structure is important. 
  Q1. VS code is .............. hard to me!! Who can tell me where I can find configure file in VS code?!?!?! 
      Where is my big leg!!!!!!!OMGGGGG search it again tomorrow
  A1. Done. 
  Q2. the meaning of the path of python????WTF!!! I don't know!!!
  A2. Done. Advanced setting-> environment variable-> add the direction of the python
      How stupid I am.....!!!
  S3. Combine Least Squares Method and Gaussian normal distribution error theory. The core thinking is that to find
      the minimum variance, then, make the data look like more linear.
  Exhausted. I cannot suffer anymore. I just want to escape from my family, my friends. Be fresh everyday!!
