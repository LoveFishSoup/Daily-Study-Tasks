Summary:
  Q1: If I wanna build a image recognition system for automatic driving, how to realize surrounding environment detection
      at night?
  A1: (SLAM. Simultaneous localization and mapping. It makes me remind my roommate----Sam. SLAM can detect the laser 
      that transfer by itself. SLAM could be useful.)
      The above solution is infeasible because SLAM rely on the reflection laser signal. Thus, it used more frequently 
      at indoor environment.
      I guess that the car could use infrared ray to detect the objects in real-time environment. Or, it could use transfer
      electromagnetic wave to detect objects and ppl.
  S2: I found that the program are quite similar in some aspects. Seems like I got something but I cannot speak it out.
  S3: php is a programming language which is more suitable for SQL because of it is a web develop language.
  S4: I bought a cloud server for fun.
